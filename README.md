# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

A pre-programmed user and profile picture is set, and tweets can be written and added. Posts pull from a existing database of users and avatars and display them. 
"Write a new tweet" toggles the view of the tweet input field. An up button is also present once users scroll down the page. 
This page has a responsive design and changes view based on device and screen width.
